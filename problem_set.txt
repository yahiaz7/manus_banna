Appendix B Loss Coefficients for Internal Flow Components

18

Notes on Major and Minor Losses in a Piping System
1. Major losses in a piping system are the direct result of fluid friction in pipes and ducting. The resulting head
losses are usually computed thru the use of friction factors.
2. Minor losses in a pipe system are due to
(a) Pipe entrance or exit
(b) Sudden expansion or contraction
(c) Bends, elbows, tees, and other fittings
(d) Valves; open or partially closed
(e) Gradual expansion or contraction
These losses may not be so minor (for example, a partially closed valve can cause a greater pressure drop than
a long pipe). Since the flow pattern in fittings and valves is very complex, the theory is very weak. The losses
are commonly measured experimentally and correlated with pipe flow parameters. The loss coefficient, K, is
usually given as a ratio of the measured minor head loss thru the device, hm = P / (  g ) , to the velocity head,

v2 / ( 2g ) of the associated piping system, i.e.

K = hm /  v2 / ( 2 g )  = P / ( 12  v 2 ) (almost all data are reported for turbulent flow conditions)

A single pipe system may have many minor losses. Since all are correlated with v2 / ( 2g ) , they can be
summed into a single total system loss if the pipe has constant diameter i.e.,
2
 fL

htotal = h f +  hm = v  +  K  where L is the total length of pipe axis
2g  D

Note, however, that we must sum the losses separately if the pipe size changes so that v 2 changes
(see White 6th Ed pp 383)
