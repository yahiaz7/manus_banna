# Problem 4.1: Shock Reflection (Appendix E)

**Problem Statement:**
This problem likely involves analyzing the reflection of an oblique shock wave from a solid boundary or a plane of symmetry, potentially referencing specific cases or diagrams in Appendix E.

**Scenario:**
Consider an oblique shock wave (Incident Shock, IS) generated by a certain deflection angle $\delta$ in a supersonic flow ($M_1$). This shock wave impinges on a solid horizontal wall or a plane of symmetry.

**Flow Pattern Description:**

1.  **Incident Shock (IS):** The flow in Region 1 ($M_1$, $\theta_1=0$) passes through the incident oblique shock, resulting in Region 2 ($M_2 < M_1$, $\theta_2 = \delta$, $P_2 > P_1$, $P_{02} < P_{01}$). The shock angle is $\beta_1$.

2.  **Reflection Process:** When the incident shock hits the wall, the flow in Region 2, which is moving towards the wall at angle $\delta$, must be turned back parallel to the wall ($\\theta_3 = 0$). This turning is accomplished by a second shock wave (Reflected Shock, RS) originating from the point of impingement.

3.  **Reflected Shock (RS):** The flow in Region 2 passes through the reflected shock, resulting in Region 3 ($M_3 < M_2$, $\theta_3 = 0$, $P_3 > P_2$, $P_{03} < P_{02}$). The reflected shock makes an angle $\beta_2$ with the direction of flow in Region 2.

**Types of Reflection:**
Two main types of reflection can occur, depending on the incident shock strength ($M_1$, $\delta$) and the specific heat ratio $\gamma$.

*   **Regular Reflection (RR):**
    *   **Description:** The incident shock and reflected shock meet at a single point on the wall. The flow is turned parallel to the wall ($\\theta_3=0$) solely by the reflected shock.
    *   **Conditions:** Occurs for weaker incident shocks (smaller $M_1$ or smaller $\delta$).
    *   **Analysis:** Given $M_1$ and $\delta$, calculate $M_2$ and $\beta_1$ using oblique shock relations. Then, consider the flow in Region 2 ($M_2$) being turned by $\delta$ (from $\theta_2=\delta$ to $\theta_3=0$) by the reflected shock. Use oblique shock relations again with upstream Mach number $M_2$ and deflection angle $\delta$ to find the reflected shock angle $\beta_2$ (relative to Region 2 flow) and the properties in Region 3 ($M_3, P_3/P_2$).

*   **Mach Reflection (MR):**
    *   **Description:** Occurs for stronger incident shocks when the required turning angle $\delta$ exceeds the maximum possible deflection angle for the Mach number $M_2$. The reflection pattern becomes more complex: the incident shock (IS), reflected shock (RS), and a nearly normal shock section called the Mach Stem (MS) meet at a Triple Point (TP) slightly above the wall. A Slip Line (SL) originates from the triple point and extends downstream, separating flow that passed through IS $\to$ RS (Region 3) from flow that passed through the Mach Stem (Region 4).
    *   **Conditions:** Occurs when the conditions for regular reflection cannot be met (i.e., required deflection $\delta$ for flow $M_2$ is greater than $\theta_{max}(M_2)$).
    *   **Analysis:** More complex. Requires satisfying conditions across IS, RS, and MS, along with compatibility at the triple point and across the slip line ($P_3=P_4$, $\theta_3=\theta_4$).
    *   **Regions:**
        *   Region 1: Upstream flow ($M_1$).
        *   Region 2: Flow behind IS ($M_2, \theta_2=\delta$).
        *   Region 3: Flow behind RS ($M_3, \theta_3$).
        *   Region 4: Flow behind MS ($M_4 < 1$, $\theta_4$).
        *   Slip Line: Separates Region 3 and 4.

**Criteria for Reflection Type:**
*   **Detachment Criterion:** Regular reflection is impossible if the required deflection angle $\delta$ is greater than the maximum deflection angle $\theta_{max}$ for the flow entering the reflected shock ($M_2$). If $\delta > \theta_{max}(M_2)$, Mach reflection must occur.
*   **Von Neumann Criterion:** Suggests that regular reflection persists only as long as the pressure behind the reflected shock ($P_3$) is less than or equal to the pressure achievable behind a normal shock at Mach number $M_1$. This criterion often predicts the transition to Mach reflection more accurately than the simple detachment criterion for certain conditions.

**Use of Appendix E:**
Appendix E likely contains diagrams illustrating regular and Mach reflection patterns, charts showing the domains of RR and MR as functions of $M_1$ and incident shock angle $\beta_1$ (or deflection angle $\delta$), or specific examples to analyze.

**Conclusion:**
Shock reflection from a wall involves an incident shock turning the flow towards the wall and a reflected shock turning it back parallel. The type of reflection (Regular or Mach) depends on the incident shock strength ($M_1, \delta$). Regular reflection occurs for weaker shocks, while Mach reflection, involving a triple point and Mach stem, occurs for stronger shocks where the flow cannot be turned back parallel by a single reflected oblique shock. Appendix E would provide specific cases or data needed to solve quantitative problems related to shock reflection.

**Equations Used (for RR analysis):**
*   Oblique Shock Relations ($\theta$-$\beta$-$M$, $M_2(M_1, \beta_1)$, $P_2/P_1(M_1, \beta_1)$, etc.) applied twice.
