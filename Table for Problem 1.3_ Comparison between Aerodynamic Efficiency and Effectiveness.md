# Table for Problem 1.3: Comparison between Aerodynamic Efficiency and Effectiveness

| Concept         | Aerodynamic Efficiency                    | Aerodynamic Effectiveness                 |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**  | Ratio of useful output to energy input or ideal output. Measures how well a process minimizes losses. | Measure of how well a device achieves its primary intended function or produces a desired effect. |
| **Focus**       | Minimizing irreversibilities (e.g., friction, heat transfer, shock losses). | Achieving the design goal (e.g., pressure rise, thrust generation, flow turning). |
| **Metrics**     | - Isentropic Efficiency ($\eta_{isen}$)
- Polytropic Efficiency
- Total Pressure Recovery ($P_{0,out}/P_{0,in}$)
- Specific Impulse ($I_{sp}$) relative to ideal | - Pressure Ratio ($P_{out}/P_{in}$)
- Thrust Coefficient ($C_F$)
- Lift Coefficient ($C_L$)
- Flow Turning Angle ($\Delta\theta$) |
| **Example (Diffuser)** | High efficiency means low $P_0$ loss. Measured by $P_{0,exit}/P_{0,inlet}$. | High effectiveness means achieving the desired static pressure rise $P_{exit}/P_{inlet}$. |
| **Example (Nozzle)** | High efficiency means low $P_0$ loss or $V_e$ close to ideal $V_{e,isen}$. Measured by $\eta_{nozzle} = V_e^2 / V_{e,isen}^2$. | High effectiveness means generating high thrust. Measured by Thrust or $C_F$. |
| **Relationship**| High efficiency often contributes to high effectiveness, but they are distinct. A device can be effective (achieve its goal) but inefficient (high losses), or vice-versa (low losses but fails to meet primary goal). | Effectiveness relates more directly to the primary function, while efficiency relates to the quality of the process. |
